# Change Log / Release Notes

## _unreleased_

  * `xftOpenFont` and `xftOpenFontXlfd` now throw exceptions if opening a
    font fails. (They used to return a null pointer, usually leading to
    crashes.)

## 0.3.4 (2021-12-11)

  * Dropped support for GHC 7.10.

  * Added `xftDrawStringFallback`, which works like `xftDrawString` but
    supports font fallback.

  * Added `xftTextAccumExtents`, which works like `xftTextExtents` but
    possibly uses different fonts for different parts of the string and
    returns the accumulative extents.

  * Added the functions `xftfont_max_ascent`, `xftfont_max_descent`, and
    `xftfont_max_height` to gain information about a non-empty list of
    `XftFont`s.

## 0.3.3 (2021-12-01)

  * Fixed flipped green/blue values in XRenderColor.

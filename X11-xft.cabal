synopsis:      Bindings to the Xft and some Xrender parts
description:   A Haskell bindings to the X Font library. With it, Haskell X11
               applications can access high quality font renderings and provide
               fonts with anti-aliasing and subpixel rendering. The bindings
               also provide minimal bindings to Xrender parts.
